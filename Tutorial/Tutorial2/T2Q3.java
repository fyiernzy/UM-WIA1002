	// What is a raw type? 
	
	// In Java, a raw type refers to a generic class or interface that is used without specifying any type parameters. 
	// For example, if you have a generic class List<T> and you use it without specifying the type parameter T, 
	// like List myList = new ArrayList();, this is a raw type.
	
	// Why is a raw type unsafe? 
	
	// It bypasses genetic type checking during compilation and lead to the runtime exception
	
	// Why is the raw type allowed in Java?
	
	// To allow backward compatibilities for legacy code since generics are introduced only in JDK 5.
