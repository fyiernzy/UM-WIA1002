My name is Ng Zhi Yang with matrix number, 22004833. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because data structure is fun.

I acquired A+ for my previous Programming I course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will try my best. Wish me luck!!!
