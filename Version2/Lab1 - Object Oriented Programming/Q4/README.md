# Solution Explanation

## Version 1
Contributor: Faker000000000

The idea behind this version is to use a 2-dimensional boolean array to "paint" the character out. We have created several methods in the `ConsoleCharacter.java` file, such as `.plotVerticalLine()` and `.plotHorizontalLine()`, to simplify the process.

For illustration, consider the following 2-dimensional boolean array:

```python
{{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
 {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
 {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
 {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
 {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '}}
```
If we want to print the letter "A", the boolean array will be:

```python
{{' ', ' ', '*', ' ', ' '},
 {' ', '*', ' ', '*', ' '},
 {' ', '*', '*', '*', ' '},
 {' ', '*', ' ', '*', ' '},
 {' ', '*', ' ', '*', ' '}}
```

Here, the initial value of the boolean array is false, and we use ' ' to represent false and '*' to represent true. To plot the "A", we can write the following code:

`java
arr[0][2] = true;
arr[1][1] = arr[1][3] = true;
arr[2][1] = arr[2][2] = arr[2][3] = true;
arr[3][1] = arr[3][3] = true;
arr[4][1] = arr[3][3] = true;
```
However, plotting a dot one by one is time-consuming, hence we have written some methods such as:

```java
protected void plotVerticalLine(boolean[][] buff, int startRow, int endRow, int column) {
		for(int i = startRow; i <= endRow; i++) 
			buff[i][column] = true;
	}
```
`.plotVerticalLine()` takes four parameters, namely buff, startRow, endRow, and column. The method plots at the specified column and plots from startRow to endRow, inclusively.

## Version 2

Version 2 of the code represents a refined approach compared to Version 1. In Version 1, a 2-dimensional boolean array was used to plot the characters, whereas in Version 2, a String and .toCharArray() were utilized instead. This new approach offers several advantages such as better maintainability, readability, and improved time complexity.

For instance, consider how the character "A" was plotted in Version 1:

```java
public boolean[][] getUppercase() {
		int column = 5;
		boolean[][] buff = getBuff(column + 2);
		plotVerticalLines(buff, 1, ROW - 1, new int[] {1, 5});
		plotHorizontalLines(buff, 2, 4, new int[] {0, 2});		
		return buff;
 }
```
 
In contrast, Version 2 handles the character "A" with the following code:

```java
public A() {
		this.ascii = 
				        "  *  \n" +
                " * * \n" +
                "*****\n" +
                "*   *\n" +
                "*   *";
}
```
The 2-dimensional array is obtained as follows:

```java
private void initialize(int space) {
		String[] lines = ascii.split("\n");
		int size = lines[0].length();
		this.character = new char[DEFAULT_HEIGHT][size + space * 2];
		for(int i = 0; i < DEFAULT_HEIGHT; i++) 
			System.arraycopy(lines[i].toCharArray(), 0, character[i], 1, size);
	}

public char[][] getCharacter() {
  if (character == null)
    initialize();
  return character;
}
```
Since it is a time-consuming task to write ASCII code for all the characters (A-Z), the generation of the ASCII code was outsourced to ChatGPT, which produced the code for the characters.

Furthermore, to adhere to good programming practices, the initialize method and getCharacter method have been separated from the A class as they are not part of the class but rather helper methods.

The prompt used is as followed:

```css
public A() {
		this.ascii = 
				        "  *  \n" +
                " * * \n" +
                "*****\n" +
                "*   *\n" +
                "*   *";
	}
}
Can you please refer to the code and write the Java class for character B through Z?
```



"## Version 3

Contributor: [Website](https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/java/ascii-art-generator-library-in-java.html)

We referred to the website above and wrote a `Banner.java` file to simplify the use of the method. The `Banner.java` file provides better control over the size, color, and font family of the message.


# Overall Guidance

To try out different versions of code, follow these steps:

1. Copy the source file to your project location.
2. Instantiate a `Banner` object in your `Main.java` file.
3. Call the `.print(String message)` method on the `Banner` object.
4. Pass the message that you want to print to the console as an argument to the method.

For Versions 1 and 2, you need to add `commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar` to your classpath. Follow these steps to add the JAR file:

1. Download the `commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar` file included in the (Lab1Q4 folder)[https://github.com/fyiernzy/UM-WIA1002/blob/main/Version2/Lab1%20-%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Q4/commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar).
2. Add the `commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar` file to your classpath. For more details, please refer to the following resources:
